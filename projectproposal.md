# sp20-516-239 Sara Lam Project Proposal

My project is "Cloudmesh Storage".  I will be working with 2 other students for the project.  We will divide the differnt clouds among us.  I will work on AWS, Azure, and Openstack.

I will register on AWS, Azure and Openstack.  The functions we will create include:

* Copy files from local computer to each cloud and verify it is done correctly
* Copy files from one cloud to another and verify it is done correctly
* Furthermore, copy multiple files in a queue, then move to the cloud
